XMLRPC Gateway Installation Instructions

* General:

  The xmlrpc gateway is an application to act as a proxy that allows 
  simulators to register the gateway uri so objects using remote data may be
  accessed from a central uri. To use the gateway, you must configure the
  simulator to use the XmlRpcGridRouter module and supply your gateway
  uri so your simulator will register open channels with the gateway 
  application. Your external applications using remote data will access the
  object in the simulator by sending the gateway an xmlrpc message with the
  channel and payload data. The gateway will proxy the call to the correct
  simulator wich will process the call then send a response. The response 
  is returned to the gateway which forwards it back to your external program.


* Web Server:

  1) Install the files into your web server document root, or prepare a new
     document root to serve the application.
 
  2) Move the config.inc file to a location outside of the document root and
     edit gate.php and index.php to adjust the location to the file.

  3) Edit config.inc and set the database connection parameters for your
     database. See: http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php for information
     about the PDO database abstraction library.

  4) Create the database...



* Database:

  1) Create the database and set permissions for the user that will access
     the data using the values in your config.inc file. See the inlcuded
     file 'gateway_data.sql' for details. This file will create the table
     for MySQL. You can make adjustments to support the databse you are
     using. See: http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php for more information



* Operation:

  1) Create an object and install the included script. Note the channel
     that is reported when the script starts.

  2) Check for the channel in the database.

  3) Use the included test to send a message into the simulator. You will
     see a report in-world and will see the returned message from the test.



* Troubleshooting:

  * Simulator<-->Gateway *
  1) Check that the channel is registered in the database.

  2) Look at your web server access and error logs to see that the simulator
     is attemting to register the channel.

  3) Check your simulator configuration for the proper module assignment and
     port assignemnt.

  4) Enable debugging in the gateway and watch the log for information.

  * Application<-->Gateway *
  1) Check your webserver access and error logs.

  2) Enable debugging in the gateway and watch the log.

  3) Be sure that the channel is valid and registered in the database.
